## React Hooks and Libraries

In addition to React, I also used various React hooks and libraries, including:

- useState
- useContext
- useEffect
- useNavigate
- styled-components
- Redux

By using these technologies and libraries, I was able to create a functional and user-friendly shopping website. I hope you enjoy browsing my website and exploring its features!

Welcome to **CRWN Clothing**! This is a shopping page where you can find a wide variety of clothes for men, women, and children. This project has a simple and user-friendly interface to help users find what they are looking for quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

The first page users will see is the sign-in page. Once successfully logged in, users will be directed to the homepage where they can browse the collections of clothing. The homepage displays the main categories of items, making it easy for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.

## Shop

The shop page is where a preview of the categories is displayed, to make the search easier for the user.

## Cart and Checkout

Also, there is a cart feature, where users can add items to cart, followed by a checkout page, where users can modify the cart's structure and see the final total value.

I envisioned **CRWN Clothing** to be the starting point to a shopping website, to better practice my React knowledge and web development skills.
