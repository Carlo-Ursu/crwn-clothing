Momentarily it works with some hardcoded users: 
    
    id: user1
    password: 1111

    id: user2
    password: 2222

    id: user3
    password: 3333
    
After login, there is a main page where the user can find all the categories in the shop

There is a shop page showing every category with a 4 items preview
There is also a cart implementation that lets users add items to their cart

Last, but not least, there is a checkout page where every user can modify their cart and see the total expenses

The project is made using React, HTML, CSS and JS.
To better suit the needs that I envisioned, I used React hooks such as: useNavigate, useState, useEffect and Redux.

Also, for designing the components, I used styled-components from React
